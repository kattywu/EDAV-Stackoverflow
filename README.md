This project looks at the trends in user content and interactivity for the popular coding forum https://stackoverflow.com/ which is a privately owned webiste and part of the Stack Exchange network of website. While the Stack Exchange network has a variety of question and answer content for almost any topic you can think of, Stack Overflow is a hub for computer programmers looking to find solutions to coding problems or just looking to learn a thing or two. Here we analyze a sample of posts made in the past seven years in search of overall trends in post subjects that may be indicative of changes in popularity among the computer programming community.
